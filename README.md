the technologies that i used to make this game are JS ,jQuery,CSS and HTML. 

i built the landing page using HTML and CSS only.

My approach to make this is as listed:-

1- i first built the structure of page using HTML and CSS when i built everything perfectly as i want it.

2- i jumped into JS and jQuery to start the real work.

3- i first tried to know what are the tools that i will need like saying i need arrays to store values of each player i need functions to count the plays and i need function to restart the game and i need a function to start the game over. i need a method to push the scores and to make them displayed on the screen. 

4- i used arrays ,if statements a lot i used an anonymous function and i used named functions.
